<h3 = align=center><em>Throughout my time here, I’ve proactively assisted other interns and community members with a wide variety of challenges—from <code>Azure virtual machine provisioning errors</code> and <code>Tenable scan issues</code> to <code>SSH/RDP connection failures</code>, <code>system service errors</code>, and <code>onboarding to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint</code>. While my role was not formally part of IT, I stepped up wherever I saw opportunities to improve technical workflows, clarify confusing documentation, or help peers overcome blockers.</em></h3>

<h3 = align=center><em>Whether guiding someone through configuring a <code>Network Security Group</code>, <code>troubleshooting a failed vulnerability scan</code>, or <code>demystifying changes in compliance templates</code>, I aimed to provide clear, practical solutions that built both trust and technical confidence within the team.</em></h3>

<h3 = align=center><em>Each case outlines a real support scenario I helped resolve, including context, steps taken, outcomes, and lessons learned.

Hello Denzel,
I just started the vulnerability management section as well and didn't receive that message.
I just wanted to verify did waiting or refreshing fix your issue
and have you run into any other issues with your VM since then?

Has anyone experience this issue or know of a fix?
Please see the screen shot attached.
Thanks in advance.

Hello Cyril,
Aside from checking your scan settings and making sure everything is correct
you could check the error messages in the "warnings" tab to see why it aborted.
Click on the scan, go to "see all details" bottom-right
and you should see why it aborted.

has anyone experienced this before?
I can ping my VM’s public IP address,

Does anyone know what might be causing this or how to fix it?
Any help would be appreciated!

Hello Tolu,
I haven't had an issue connecting to my Linux VM,
but my suggestion would be to ensure everything is correct: username, password, public IP address,
and perhaps using "Command Prompt" instead of "Windows PowerShell."
If all else fails,
delete the VM and restart from the beginning
and pay close attention to the setup video.
```

### 🟢 𝚃𝙷𝙴 𝚂𝙾𝙻𝚄𝚃𝙸𝙾𝙽:</br>*I advised the student to first verify the key connection details:*

### *1. Ensure the correct username and password are being used*</br>*2. Confirm the public IP address of the virtual machine*</br>*3.

Delete the VM and recreate it, making sure to configure it correctly during provisioning*
