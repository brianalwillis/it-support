<h3 = align=center><em>This portfolio highlights the hands-on technical experience, problem-solving strategies, and team support I provided during my internship at `LOG(N) Pacific`.</em></h3>

<h3 = align=center><em>Throughout my time here, I’ve proactively assisted interns and community members with a wide variety of challenges—from Azure virtual machine provisioning errors and Tenable scan issues to SSH/RDP connection failures, system service errors, and onboarding to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. While my role was not formally part of IT, I stepped up wherever I saw opportunities to improve technical workflows, clarify confusing documentation, or help peers overcome blockers.</em></h3>

<h3 = align=center><em>Whether guiding someone through configuring a Network Security Group, troubleshooting a failed vulnerability scan, or demystifying changes in compliance templates, I aimed to provide clear, practical solutions that built both trust and technical confidence within the team.</em></h3>

<h3 = align=center><em>Each case outlines a real support scenario I helped resolve, including context, steps taken, outcomes, and lessons learned. My goal is not just to demonstrate my technical skills, but also my initiative, communication, and collaborative mindset when tackling challenges.</em></h3>

<h3 = align=center><em>Thank you for taking the time to review my work! I hope this portfolio gives insight into how I approach problems, support others, and contribute value to a team.</em></h3>

### **USER:** *`Denzel`*</br>**SUBJECT:** *`"Is this a problem?"`*
```
I just started the vulnerability section, and it says virtual machine agent status not ready.
I don' think it matters too much.
It lets me open my VM normally, but I'd like to make sure.
I followed everything to the T.
```

### 🔴 𝚃𝙷𝙴 𝙿𝚁𝙾𝙱𝙻𝙴𝙼:</br>*An intern encountered an `error message` immediately after creating a `virtual machine` in `Microsoft Azure`. The message caused uncertainty about whether the VM had been successfully deployed, resulting in confusion and concern.*

### **FROM:** *`Briana`*</br>**TO:** *`Denzel`*
```
Hello Denzel,
I just started the vulnerability management section as well and didn't receive that message.
I just wanted to verify did waiting or refreshing fix your issue
and have you run into any other issues with your VM since then?
```

### 🟢 𝚃𝙷𝙴 𝚂𝙾𝙻𝚄𝚃𝙸𝙾𝙽:</br>*I explained that Azure VM provisioning often takes a few minutes to complete and that the portal may temporarily display errors while resources are being configured in the background. I advised the student to:*

### *1. Wait a few minutes*</br>*2. Refresh the Azure portal to check the VM status*

---

### ⚪ 𝚃𝙷𝙴 𝙾𝚄𝚃𝙲𝙾𝙼𝙴:</br>*After a short time, the student confirmed that the VM had been successfully deployed and was accessible.*

### 🔵 𝙻𝙴𝚂𝚂𝙾𝙽𝚂 𝙻𝙴𝙰𝚁𝙽𝙴𝙳:</br>- *`Cloud provisioning delays` are common and often resolved without intervention—knowing when to wait vs. escalate is essential.*</br>- *`Clear, calm communication` helped the student feel supported and confident rather than frustrated.*</br>- *`Verifying issues independently` before concluding helps provide accurate support and build trust.*
