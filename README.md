<h3 = align=center><em>This portfolio highlights the hands-on technical experience, problem-solving strategies, and team support I provided during my cybersecurity internship at <code>LOG(N) Pacific</code>.</em></h3>

<h3 = align=center><em>Throughout my time here, I’ve proactively assisted other interns and community members with a wide variety of challenges—from <code>Azure virtual machine provisioning errors</code> and <code>Tenable scan issues</code> to <code>SSH/RDP connection failures</code>, <code>system service errors</code>, and <code>onboarding to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint</code>. While my role was not formally part of IT, I stepped up wherever I saw opportunities to improve technical workflows, clarify confusing documentation, or help peers overcome blockers.</em></h3>

<h3 = align=center><em>Whether guiding someone through configuring a <code>Network Security Group</code>, <code>troubleshooting a failed vulnerability scan</code>, or <code>demystifying changes in compliance templates</code>, I aimed to provide clear, practical solutions that built both trust and technical confidence within the team.</em></h3>

<h3 = align=center><em>Each case outlines a real support scenario I helped resolve, including context, steps taken, outcomes, and lessons learned. My goal is not just to demonstrate my technical skills, but also my initiative, communication, and collaborative mindset when tackling challenges.</em></h3>

<h3 = align=center><em>Thank you for taking the time to review my work! I hope this portfolio gives insight into how I approach problems, support others, and contribute value to a team.</em></h3>

```
I just started the vulnerability section, and it says virtual machine agent status not ready.
I don't think it matters too much.
It lets me open my VM normally, but I'd like to make sure.
I followed everything to the T.
```

### 🔴 𝚃𝙷𝙴 𝙿𝚁𝙾𝙱𝙻𝙴𝙼:</br>*An intern encountered an `error message` immediately after creating a `virtual machine` in `Microsoft Azure`. The message caused uncertainty about whether the VM had been successfully deployed, resulting in confusion and concern.*

Hello Denzel,
I just started the vulnerability management section as well and didn't receive that message.
I just wanted to verify did waiting or refreshing fix your issue
and have you run into any other issues with your VM since then?
```

### 🟢 𝚃𝙷𝙴 𝚂𝙾𝙻𝚄𝚃𝙸𝙾𝙽:</br>*I explained that Azure VM provisioning often takes a few minutes to complete and that the portal may temporarily display errors while resources are being configured in the background. I advised the student to:*

### *1. Wait a few minutes*</br>*2. Refresh the Azure portal to check the VM status*

### ⚪ 𝚃𝙷𝙴 𝙾𝚄𝚃𝙲𝙾𝙼𝙴:</br>*After a short time, the student confirmed that the VM had been successfully deployed and was accessible.*

I’m trying to download the ANKI deck interview questions but this is what I keep getting.
Take a look at the pic.
Do you guys have the same issue?
```

### 🔴 𝚃𝙷𝙴 𝙿𝚁𝙾𝙱𝙻𝙴𝙼:</br>*An intern encountered difficulties accessing the `Cyber Interview Questions resource`, which was provided as an `Anki flashcard deck`. The issue stemmed from not having the `Anki app` installed, leading to confusion about how to properly open and use the resources.*

### **FROM:** *`Briana`*</br>**TO:** *`Rora`*
```
Hello Rora,
Do you have the ANKI app downloaded?
Download the ANKI app here https://apps.ankiweb.net/ and when you open the interview questions,
you should be prompted to import the cards into your ANKI deck.
```

### 🟢 𝚃𝙷𝙴 𝚂𝙾𝙻𝚄𝚃𝙸𝙾𝙽:</br>*I walked the community member through the process of setting up Anki:*

### *1. Directed them to download and install the official Anki app*</br>*2. Advised them to import the flashcard deck directly into the platform*</br>*3. Ensured they could see and use the cards within Anki’s interface*

Hey guys,
I am currently in the vulnearability management section of the cyber range,
and i am on the part where we create virtual machines with a public ip address.
i'm in Vulnerability Management w/ Tenable > Accessing Tenable and Azure > Public IP
How to Create An Azure Virtual Machine.
whenever i click nsg-cyber-range-2 here:
i always get the message you do not have access,
and i can't create any port rules as well as it says the same thing.
I would appreciate any help
```

### 🔴 𝚃𝙷𝙴 𝙿𝚁𝙾𝙱𝙻𝙴𝙼:</br>*An intern attempted to access a `Network Security Group` (NSG) within the `Cyber Range` environment but encountered a `permissions error`. They were trying to interact with an `NSG` they weren’t authorized to manage, leading to confusion about how to proceed with their `VM setup`.*

### **FROM:** *`Briana`*</br>**TO:** *`Chiemelie`*
```
Hey Chiemelie,
So you're on the nsg-cyber-range-2.
The one below that is your network security group.
Here is where you'll create a new port rule:

```

### 🟢 𝚃𝙷𝙴 𝚂𝙾𝙻𝚄𝚃𝙸𝙾𝙽:</br>*I explained that each student is provisioned with their own NSG within a dedicated resource group. I guided the student to:*

### *1. Locate their personal NSG within their assigned resource group*</br>*2. Understand the purpose and structure of inbound port rules*</br>*3. Create a new inbound rule as required for the exercise*
