<h3 = align=center><em>This portfolio highlights the hands-on technical experience, problem-solving strategies, and team support I provided during my cybersecurity internship at <code>LOG(N) Pacific</code>.</em></h3>

<h3 = align=center><em>Throughout my time here, I’ve proactively assisted other interns and community members with a wide variety of challenges—from <code>Azure virtual machine provisioning errors</code> and <code>Tenable scan issues</code> to <code>SSH/RDP connection failures</code>, <code>system service errors</code>, and <code>onboarding to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint</code>. While my role was not formally part of IT, I stepped up wherever I saw opportunities to improve technical workflows, clarify confusing documentation, or help peers overcome blockers.</em></h3>

<h3 = align=center><em>Whether guiding someone through configuring a <code>Network Security Group</code>, <code>troubleshooting a failed vulnerability scan</code>, or <code>demystifying changes in compliance templates</code>, I aimed to provide clear, practical solutions that built both trust and technical confidence within the team.</em></h3>

<h3 = align=center><em>Each case outlines a real support scenario I helped resolve, including context, steps taken, outcomes, and lessons learned.

Hello Denzel,
I just started the vulnerability management section as well and didn't receive that message.
I just wanted to verify did waiting or refreshing fix your issue
and have you run into any other issues with your VM since then?
```

### 🟢 𝚃𝙷𝙴 𝚂𝙾𝙻𝚄𝚃𝙸𝙾𝙽:</br>*I explained that Azure VM provisioning often takes a few minutes to complete and that the portal may temporarily display errors while resources are being configured in the background. I advised the student to:*

Hello Tolu,
I haven't had an issue connecting to my Linux VM,

Hi guys,
just wanted to know whoever completed this lab -
how long did it take for tenable in the vm to trigger the start.txt file.
In the video he estimated his taking 15 minutes.
Personally Im at over an hour now and it still hasn't triggered the file.
Its running in tenable but the file still hasn't deleted from the triggers folder.
So just polling to see how long should I expect to wait.

As long as the scan detects at least some of the deliberately introduced vulnerabilities (e.g., outdated software, insecure configurations), it should be considered valid*</br>*3.

Your NSG should be right below the Cyber Range NSG like in the screenshot.
If you don't see your VM's NSG I'd recommend deleting the VM
and recreating it while following along closely to Josh's video again.
Perhaps you missed a step / setting.

Hey Range,
having some issues onboarding my newly created VM to MDE.
I downloaded the package from {link} -
the lab for "Onboarding a VM to MDE, Isolation, and Investigation".
Unzipped the the enclosed text file but stuck at that point.
Any tips would be helpful.

### **FROM:** *`Briana`*</br>**TO:** *`Demetrious`*
```
Hello Demetrious,
After you unzipped the package
try to change the directory "cd mde_onboarding" to check if you have the file "MicrosoftDefenderATPOnboardingLinuxServer.py".
Make sure the script is executable "chmod +x MicrosoftDefenderATPOnboardingLinuxServer.py"
then run it "sudo ./MicrosoftDefenderATPOnboardingLinuxServer.py".
Hope this helps!
```

### 🟢 𝚃𝙷𝙴 𝚂𝙾𝙻𝚄𝚃𝙸𝙾𝙽:</br>*Since the student’s immediate goal was to complete the “Onboarding a VM to MDE” lab, I recommended a more accessible approach using Windows. Specifically, I:*

### *1. Suggested creating a Windows 10 VM instead, which aligns with the official lab video tutorial by Josh*</br>*2. Explained that Windows onboarding is more straightforward for first-time MDE users and better supported by the lab materials*</br>*3. Provided a step-by-step guide from an IR community lab for onboarding Linux VMs to MDE for future reference*

---

### ⚪ 𝚃𝙷𝙴 𝙾𝚄𝚃𝙲𝙾𝙼𝙴:</br>*The student proceeded with the Windows 10 VM option and completed the lab using the video tutorial. They also saved the Linux onboarding guide for future use.*

Hello Denzel
This isn't an issue.
The string of characters you're seeing is just the hash of someone's username.
